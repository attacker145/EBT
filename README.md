# EBT - Elevated body temperature detector with a cloud interface (home made).
Project on Hackaday: https://hackaday.io/project/170728-elevated-body-temperature-detector-cloud-enabled
The system constantly runs and check for movement in the area. If movement is detected, sonic sensors estimate distance to a closest target and IR sensor takes IR readings. If IR readings from all four sensors are higher than a threshold "EBT" is reported. The system also runs and post data to the web-page when no motion is detected or when only motion is detected (no EBT).
